# Contributing to elevety-stock-gallery

I welcome any and all community contributions to eleventy-stock-gallery. I'm in the process of transitioning out the basic [Sharp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sharp) implementation for serving responsive images with [eleventy-img](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-img). Feel free to open an issue and consider helping out with any aspect of the project. 

## Setup
1. This project uses npm to manage packages used, from the root directory run:
```
# Installs dependencies (eleventy, sharp, eleventy-img)
npm install
```
2. Build Static Site
```
npm run build
```
3. Server setup
```
# Opens a local development server
npm run serve
```
4. Create a new branch or simply push from `master`.
```
git checkout -b <branch>
```
5. Commit your file changes and push
6. Open a PR and wait for changes to be reviewed.

Thank you for all of your help and contributions! :)
